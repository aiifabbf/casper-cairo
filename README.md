# casper-cairo
cairo's pure python and pycairo-compatible binding, as a drawing backend of casper project

This project is inspired by [Qahriah](https://github.com/ldo/qahirah), which is the original cairo's pure python binding using python's builtin facility ctypes. Since Qahriah invents a different interface compared with the official python binding pycairo, this project tries to provide APIs that are as compatible as to pycairo.
